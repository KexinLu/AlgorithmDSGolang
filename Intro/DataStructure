# Data Structure


## Why do we need data structure?

- Data structure helps us organize data into a format which makes it easier to store/retrieve data when using some coding pattern
- Data structure helps us write cleaner code

## Abstract Data Types

- ADT is basically interface of a data structure
- ADT only provides interface but no specific details
eg.
     List { Slice (ArrayList), LinkedList, etc. }
     Queue { Linked List, Heap, etc. }
     Map


## How to Get big O

- Big O is an estimation, we should only keep the highest order item.
eg.

O(2n) ~> O(n)
O(n^2 + 2n) ~> O(n^2)

- Binary operation(eg. binary search) would turn an O(n) operation to O(logN). (In cs log is base 2 not 10)
- For comparasion search, the lower limit of O is O(nlogn), to have a better performance you need to use counting sort or radix sort or other sorting method
